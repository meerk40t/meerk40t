"""
This file class/collection is part of an exploration of the modification scheme.

This highlights problems and requirements for lazy modifications of elements.
"""


class Modification(list):
    """
    Modifications are intended to be lazy implemented changes to SVGElement objects and groups. The intent is to
    provide a method for delayed modifications of data. In a modification tree.

    Modifications are functions called on other Modifications. With end-nodes that wrap the core work types.
    Type Input is the input type kind of element this is intended to act upon.
    Type Output is the output type of the element this is intended to produce.

    External modifications are performed by programs usually with command line accesses. These may fail.

    Established datatypes are:
    element, shape, path, rect, circle, polyline, polygon, image, blob_ruida, blob_gcode, blob_lhymicro

    The output type of a modification counts as that type of object, in a lazy fashion. If the object is required,
    then .get() should be called. This will create a cached object, by applying the modification and producing the
    promised object.

    and since we use the initial copy, all values on that work chain are negated.
