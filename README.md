# MeerK40t
MeerK40t (pronounced MeerKat) is a built-from-the-ground-up MIT licensed open-source laser cutting software. It's a replacement for LaserDrw, Corel Laser, and K40 Whisperer. 

MeerK40t is designed specifically for stock K40 lasers with Lhymicro laser controllers like the M2-Nano, and will not work with other controller boards.

It supports two sets of drivers which come with the software supplied with the K40 and which are used by Whisperer and the default USB drivers,
and so MeerK40t can usually run alongside these other pieces of software but without requiring them as a pre-requisite.

MeerK40t is written in Python and precompiled versions are [available for download](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/releases) for Windows, Mac OSX, Linux and Raspberry Pi. 

Alternatively you can run MeerK40t directly from Python.
