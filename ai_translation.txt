Use this prompt to translate delta_es.po file (maximum chunk size 1000 lines for Google Gemini)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From now on I will paste text into this chat window, that will contain msgid/msgstr pairs in gnu gettext format.
Translate all empty msgstr into Spanish (using proper terminology for a laser engraving software).
One additional rule: all strings inside curly brackets should not be translated.

Keep the original format when showing the results, avoiding categorizing or any
other additional comments that are not part of the original file.
The result should be easy to copy and paste into another file.
There is no need to escape strings - neither in the response or when providing a clipboard copy.

For smaller delta_xx files, this works well:
--------------------------------------------
- Look at all delta_xx.po files in the project root directory. Each file contains GNU gettext information.
- Translate all untranslated msgstr elements - establish the language from the file extension: the filename consists of a "delta_" start followed by an ISO language code, ended by a ".po" extension.
- Use for the translation proper terminology appropriate for laser engraving software.
- Strings inside curly brackets should not be translated and all curly brackets need to be reused.
- Make sure strings are utf8 encoded
- Optimize the token consumption by batching translation and update efforts
- Repeat the process until all untranslated strings are translated.

b) translate as well the subsequent lines until they start with a "cmd=" or an "img=" or a "version=" string
c) leave lines unchanged if they start with a "#"
d) keep the general format
Now the text:
