## Pull Requests

Code improvements and language improvements need to be submitted as Pull Requests.
Usually you will need to:

1.  On Github, fork the [MeerK40t/MeerK40t repo](/meerk40t/meerk40t),
2.  Use Git to clone your fork to your computer
3.  Create a new Git branch for your changes
4.  Code and test your changes
5.  Use Git to push them up to Github; and
6.  Create a Github Push Request.

If you are not a Git expert (and how many of us are?),
you may want to install Github Desktop to make this easy for you.

When you are submitting a Pull Request:

1.  Please feel free to submit incomplete changes if you want early feedback.
Please mark such submissions as **Draft** until they are ready for formal review.
2.  Where appropriate add new Unit Tests.
Please ensure that both existing and new Unit Tests run cleanly when you have finished coding.
