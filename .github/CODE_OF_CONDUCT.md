# MeerK40t Code of Conduct

This page is provided to set expectations about how all contributors to the MeerK40t project,
big or small, are expected to behave towards one another and to the project as a whole.

## Overview

We want the MeerK40t project to be an open and welcoming environment.
We expect contributors to make participation a harassment-free experience
but without limiting people's willingness or ability to engage in lively debate.

People are welcome to participate of all ages, body sizes, with or without visible or invisible disability,
of any ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender/sexual identity/orientation/expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race/caste/color, or religion.

These are not important factors. What is important is what you can contribute to the project -
though, we should stress that the level of your contribution is not a valid excuse for poor behaviour.

In simple terms, you are free to hold contrary opinions and to disagree,
but equally you need respect other people's right to a viewpoint that is different from yours,
and to debate the opinion and **not** the person or their character or personality.
Equally, if you are unable to rationally defend your viewpoint if it is challenged,
please do not incorrectly claim any of the above without genuine merit purely as an alternative.

## What happens if someone does make a complaint?

We hope that people will be tolerant of other people's differing views and opinions,
and that people will view others for what they do deliver to the project and not be
over-sensitive if the ideals we would like to aspire to are not met 100% -
after all we are all human and all make mistakes at times.

If people make complaints over small matters, this can easily create a worse environment
than the behaviours being complained about - so please try to heal wounds rather than open them wider.
That said, we do not want to trivialise serious or persistent/frequent inappropriate behaviours,
complaints about which will always be treated seriously.

## Flagging concerns

Instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported in confidence by contacting @Tatarize via GitHub or Discord.
