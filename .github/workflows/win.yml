# Yikes. ch341dll.dll is not compatible with 64-bit python/pyinstaller/ctypes
#
# Python 3.7, wxPython 4.0.7-post2 is specifically chosen to workaround
# issue meerk40t/meerk40t#242, once the SetLocale issue is resolved, we can test
# newer versions again. Python 3.8 is latest possible for Windows 7 support.
