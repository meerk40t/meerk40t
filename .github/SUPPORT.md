# Support

The MeerK40t development team try hard to be responsive to difficulties experienced by users,
whether they are bugs or simply difficulties in using MeerK40t.

However, we do ask that you only use [GitHub Issues](/meerk40t/meerk40t/issues) to make formal bug reports
or make fully formed suggestions for improvements.

If you are not ready to make a formal report, then do please come and discuss it with the MeerK40t team
using one of the following links:
*   [Discord](https://discord.gg/vkDD3HdQq6)

Please see also the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
