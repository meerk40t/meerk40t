For the Linux afficionados:

1) pypotrace is used for faster bitmap vectorisation - I was able to install it via

	sudo apt install libagg-dev libpotrace-dev
	pip3 install pypotrace


2) pyclipr (used for faster and better offset calculation eg with kerf) needed

	sudo apt install cmake libeigen3-dev
	pip3 install pyclipr

3) If you need to build wxpython yourself, you need to install the gtk development libraries
	sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
