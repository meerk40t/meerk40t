## Description

The Balor Controller panel is the central control interface for Balor-series laser devices. Balor lasers are high-speed galvo-based systems that require precise communication protocols and real-time monitoring. This panel provides users with direct control over device connectivity and comprehensive visibility into the communication stream between MeerK40t and the laser hardware.

The controller integrates with the underlying GalvoController system, which handles the complex translation between high-level laser commands and the low-level USB protocol that Balor devices use. This includes managing connection states, handling communication errors, and providing detailed logging for troubleshooting.

## How to Use

### Accessing the Controller Panel

1. Ensure you have a Balor device selected and activated
2. Navigate to **Window** → **Device-Control** → **Balor-Controller**
3. The Balor Controller panel will open showing connection status and USB logs

### Key Features

- **Connection Control**: Manual connect/disconnect with visual status indicators
- **Real-time USB Logging**: Live display of all communication with the laser device
- **Status Monitoring**: Automatic status updates and connection state feedback
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection failures and communication issues
- **Signal Integration**: Responds to `pipe;usb_status` and `balor_controller_update` signals

### Basic Usage

1. **Check Connection Status**: The panel opens showing current connection state
2. **Connect to Device**: Click the "Connection" button to establish communication
3. **Monitor Communication**: Watch the USB log area for real-time communication data
4. **Disconnect if Needed**: Click the button again to disconnect from the device
5. **Troubleshoot Issues**: Use the log data to diagnose connection or communication problems

### Connection Management

The "Connection" button serves dual purposes:
- **Green Background**: Device is connected and communicating properly
- **Yellow Background**: Device is disconnected or connection attempt failed
- **Button Text**: Shows current connection status ("Connection", "Connected", "Connecting", etc.)

## Technical Details

The Balor Controller panel integrates with several key MeerK40t systems:

- **Device Service Integration**: Connects to the active Balor device service
- **USB Communication Layer**: Interfaces with the GalvoController for low-level device communication
- **Signal System**: Responds to kernel signals for status updates and log messages
- **Threading**: Uses background threading for non-blocking USB log updates
- **Channel Watching**: Monitors device-specific USB communication channels

### USB Communication Flow

1. **Connection Establishment**: Panel initiates connection through GalvoController
2. **Device Initialization**: Controller sends initialization commands (reset, enable laser, set modes)
3. **Command Translation**: High-level operations converted to device-specific USB packets
4. **Status Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of device status and communication health
5. **Log Streaming**: All USB packets logged in real-time for debugging

### GalvoController Integration

The backend GalvoController handles:
- **Protocol Translation**: Converts MeerK40t commands to Balor USB protocol
- **List Command Management**: Batches commands into efficient packet sequences
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection and error handling
- **Device-Specific Logic**: Handles different laser sources (fiber, CO2, UV) appropriately

### Signal Integration

The panel responds to these key signals:
- **`pipe;usb_status`**: Updates connection status and button appearance
- **`balor_controller_update`**: Triggers USB log text updates in the GUI
- **Device activation signals**: Automatically updates when devices change

## Safety Considerations

- **Connection Stability**: Monitor connection status during critical operations
- **USB Communication**: Ensure stable USB connection to prevent data corruption
- **Device State**: Always verify device status before starting laser operations
- **Error Monitoring**: Pay attention to USB logs for signs of communication issues
- **Emergency Disconnect**: Use the disconnect button if communication becomes unstable

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Device won't connect or connection fails
- **Check USB Connection**: Ensure device is properly plugged in and recognized by OS
- **Verify Device Selection**: Confirm correct Balor device is selected in device manager
- **Check USB Drivers**: On Windows, ensure libusb drivers are installed via Zadig
- **Review USB Logs**: Look for specific error messages in the log area
- **Try Manual Connect**: Click connection button multiple times if needed

**Problem**: Connection drops during operation
- **Check USB Cable**: Try a different USB cable or port
- **Power Supply**: Ensure device has stable power source
- **USB Bandwidth**: Close other USB devices that may cause interference
- **Driver Issues**: Reinstall USB drivers if problems persist

### Communication Errors

**Problem**: USB logs show repeated errors
- **Device Compatibility**: Verify device firmware is compatible with MeerK40t
- **Configuration Issues**: Check device settings in Balor Configuration panel
- **Hardware Problems**: Test device with manufacturer's software if available
- **Log Analysis**: Save USB logs and report specific error patterns

**Problem**: Commands not executing on device
- **Connection Status**: Verify device shows as connected (green button)
- **Device Ready**: Check that device initialization completed successfully
- **Command Format**: Ensure operations are properly configured for Balor device
- **Buffer Issues**: Clear any pending operations that may be blocking execution

### Status Indicator Issues

**Problem**: Status button doesn't update properly
- **Signal Issues**: Restart MeerK40t to reset signal handlers
- **Device Changes**: Re-select device in device manager
- **Panel Refresh**: Close and reopen the controller panel

### Log Display Problems

**Problem**: USB logs not appearing or updating
- **Channel Watching**: Ensure panel is properly monitoring USB channel
- **Threading Issues**: Restart panel or application if updates stop
- **Buffer Limits**: Very long sessions may hit log buffer limits
