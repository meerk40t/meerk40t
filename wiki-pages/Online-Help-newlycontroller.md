## Description

The Newly Controller is essential for managing the USB connection between MeerK40t and your Newly laser device. It provides a visual interface to connect/disconnect from the device, monitor connection status, and view real-time communication logs. This is particularly useful for troubleshooting connection issues, monitoring device communication, and ensuring reliable laser operation.

## How to Use

### Available Controls

- **Connection Button**: Main control for connecting/disconnecting from the device

### Key Features

- Integrates with: `newly_controller_update`
- Integrates with: `pipe;usb_status`
- Real-time USB communication logging
- Visual connection status indicators
- Connection state management

### Basic Usage

1. **Open Controller Panel**: Access from Device-Control â†’ Newly-Controller menu
2. **Check Connection Status**: Observe button color and label for current state
3. **Connect Device**: Click the Connection button when disconnected (yellow)
4. **Monitor Communication**: Watch the USB log for device interactions
5. **Disconnect if Needed**: Click button again when connected (green) to disconnect

## Connection States

### Visual Indicators

**Disconnected State**:
- Button background: Yellow (#dfdf00)
- Button icon: Disconnected symbol
- Button label: Shows current USB status

**Connected State**:
- Button background: Green (#00ff00)
- Button icon: Connected symbol
- Button label: Shows active connection status

**Connecting State**:
- Button shows intermediate status during connection attempts

## USB Communication Log

### Log Display

The large text area at the bottom displays real-time USB communication logs including:
- Connection attempts and status messages
- Device identification information
- Command transmissions
- Error messages and warnings
- Status updates from the laser device

### Log Features

- **Auto-scrolling**: New messages automatically appear at the bottom
- **Thread-safe**: Uses locking mechanisms for concurrent access
- **Monospaced font**: Easy-to-read technical formatting
- **Persistent display**: Shows communication history during the session

## Technical Details

The NewlyControllerPanel class extends wx.ScrolledWindow and provides a comprehensive USB interface management system.

**Key Technical Components**:
- Thread-safe buffer management for log updates
- Signal listeners for USB status changes (`pipe;usb_status`)
- Channel watching for device-specific communication
- Connection state management with visual feedback
- Integration with device driver connection methods

**Communication Flow**:
1. User clicks Connection button
2. Panel checks current connection state via `service.driver.connected`
3. Issues `usb_connect` or `usb_disconnect` commands to kernel
4. Monitors status changes through signal listeners
5. Updates UI and logs communication events

**USB Channel Monitoring**:
- Watches device-specific channel: `{device_safe_label}/usb`
- Buffers incoming messages for thread-safe GUI updates
- Signals GUI updates through `newly_controller_update`

## Usage Guidelines

### Connection Management

**Initial Setup**:
1. Ensure your Newly device is powered on and USB cable is connected
2. Open the Newly Controller panel
3. Click the Connection button to establish communication
4. Verify connection by checking button color change and log messages

**Troubleshooting Connections**:
1. Check USB cable connections
2. Verify device power status
3. Look for error messages in the communication log
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting if issues persist

### Monitoring Operations

**During Laser Jobs**:
- Keep the controller panel open to monitor communication
- Watch for any error messages or connection warnings
- Use the log to verify command transmission to the device

**Debugging Issues**:
- Communication logs help identify timing issues
- Status messages reveal device state changes
- Error logs assist in diagnosing hardware problems

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Problems

**Device Not Found**:
- Verify USB cable is securely connected
- Check that the device is powered on
- Try different USB ports
- Check device manager for driver issues

**Connection Drops**:
- Monitor the communication log for error patterns
- Check USB cable quality and length
- Verify power supply stability
- Look for electromagnetic interference sources

**Communication Errors**:
- Review log messages for specific error codes
- Check device firmware version compatibility
- Verify MeerK40t version compatibility
- Test with different USB cables

### Performance Issues

**Slow Response**:
- Check USB port speed (should be USB 2.0 or higher)
- Monitor system resource usage
- Close unnecessary applications
- Update USB drivers

**Log Overload**:
- High-frequency logging may impact performance
- Consider filtering log levels if available
- Monitor system memory usage during extended sessions

## Advanced Features

### Real-time Monitoring

The controller provides live monitoring capabilities:
- **Status Updates**: Immediate visual feedback on connection state
- **Communication Logs**: Detailed record of all USB transactions
