## How to Use

### Accessing the Tips System

The Tips system can be accessed in several ways:

1. **Automatic Display**: Tips can appear automatically at startup (if enabled)
2. **Manual Access**: Through the Help menu â†’ Tips & Tricks
3. **Window Access**: Via the `window open Tips` command in the console

### Available Controls

- **Tip Display Area**: Shows the current tip text with optional image
- **Previous/Next Buttons**: Navigate through available tips
- **Tip Counter**: Shows current position (e.g., "Tip 3/12")
- **Try it Out Button**: Executes the tip's example command (when available)
- **Show tips at startup** (Checkbox): Controls automatic tip display on application start
- **Automatically Update** (Checkbox): Enables downloading new tips from the internet

### Key Features

- **Interactive Examples**: Many tips include executable commands you can try immediately
- **Visual Aids**: Tips can include images or icons to illustrate concepts
- **Version Awareness**: Tips are filtered based on your MeerK40t version
- **Offline Capability**: Works without internet connection using cached tips
- **Localization**: Tips are available in multiple languages when supported

### Basic Usage

1. **View Tips**: Open the Tips window to see helpful information about MeerK40t features
2. **Navigate**: Use Previous/Next buttons to browse through available tips
3. **Try Examples**: Click "Try it out" on tips with interactive examples to see features in action
4. **Configure Display**: Use the startup checkbox to control when tips appear automatically
5. **Update Content**: Enable automatic updates to get new tips from MeerK40t's repository

### Advanced Usage

- **Console Integration**: Tips can execute console commands to demonstrate features
- **Web Links**: Some tips link to external resources like YouTube tutorials
- **Image Caching**: Tips with images are cached locally for offline viewing
- **Version Filtering**: Only shows tips compatible with your MeerK40t version
- **Manual Updates**: Click the update checkbox to refresh tip content

## Technical Details

The Tips system is implemented as a sophisticated content management and display system:

- **Tip Storage**: Tips are stored in a structured format with text, commands, and image URLs
- **Caching System**: Images are downloaded and cached locally in the user's work directory
- **Version Control**: Tips include version requirements to ensure compatibility
- **Localization**: Supports multiple languages through separate tip files
- **Update Mechanism**: Downloads new tips from GitHub repository when permitted

The system uses a local cache file (`tips.txt`) in the user's work directory and can automatically update from MeerK40t's GitHub repository. Images are cached in a `tip_images` subdirectory to enable offline viewing.

### Tip Format Structure

Each tip consists of three main components:
1. **Text Content**: The main tip description (supports multi-line text)
2. **Command**: Optional executable command for interactive examples
3. **Image**: Optional visual aid (URL or local icon)

### Permission and Privacy

The system respects user privacy:
- **Consent Required**: Internet access for updates requires explicit user permission
- **Local Caching**: All content is stored locally after download
- **No Tracking**: The system does not send usage data or personal information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Images not loading**: Check internet permission settings or use offline cached tips
- **Tips not updating**: Ensure "Automatically Update" is enabled and internet access is permitted
- **Missing tips**: Verify your MeerK40t version supports the displayed tips
- **Commands not working**: Some tips may require specific elements or conditions to be present

### Performance Considerations

- **Image Caching**: Large images are automatically scaled to fit the display area
- **Memory Usage**: Tips are loaded on-demand to minimize memory footprint
- **Network Usage**: Updates only occur when explicitly requested and permitted
