# Online Help: Hinges

## Overview

This help page covers the **Living Hinges** functionality in MeerK40t.

Living hinges are an innovative laser cutting technique that creates flexible joints in rigid materials. By strategically removing material in precise patterns, you can transform normally inflexible materials like wood, acrylic, or plastic into bendable components that maintain their structural integrity while gaining surprising flexibility.

## What is a Living Hinge?

A **living hinge** is an intentional, controlled removal of material that allows rigid materials to bend, flex, and articulate. Unlike traditional mechanical hinges that require separate moving parts, living hinges are created by:

- **Strategic material removal**: Laser-cut patterns that create thin, flexible connections between rigid sections
- **Controlled flexibility**: Precise kerf spacing and depth that allows bending without breaking
- **Integrated design**: The hinge becomes part of the material itself, not an added component

### How Living Hinges Work

When you laser-cut a living hinge pattern:

1. **Material bridges** are left between cut sections, creating flexible connections
2. **Kerf spacing** determines bend radius and flexibility
3. **Pattern design** affects strength, range of motion, and durability
4. **Material thickness** influences how much the hinge can bend before failing

### Applications and Uses

Living hinges excel in applications requiring:
- **Box lids and enclosures** that open/close repeatedly
- **Spring mechanisms** for energy storage and return
- **Articulated structures** like robotic joints or linkages
- **Flexible connectors** between rigid components
- **Prototyping** movable mechanisms without assembly

### Material Considerations

Living hinges work best with:
- **Wood**: Creates natural, organic flexing motion
- **Acrylic/Plexiglass**: Clean cuts, predictable bending
- **Cardboard/Corrugated**: Inexpensive prototyping material
- **Thin metals**: With appropriate power settings

The key is understanding that you're not just cutting shapes - you're engineering flexibility into rigid materials.

**Tools**

## Description

The Living Hinges tool provides comprehensive control over hinge pattern generation, allowing you to create flexible connections in laser-cut materials. The tool offers multiple pattern types, adjustable parameters, and real-time preview to help you design hinges that meet your specific flexibility and strength requirements.

Key capabilities include:
- **Multiple pattern types**: From simple parallel cuts to complex interlocking designs
- **Parameter control**: Adjust spacing, depth, rotation, and shape characteristics
- **Real-time preview**: See exactly how your hinge will look before cutting
- **Shape integration**: Apply hinges to any selected shape or create rectangular patterns
- **Optimization algorithms**: Choose between pattern-based and direct grid generation methods

## How to Use

### Basic Workflow

1. **Select a shape** (optional): Choose the area where you want to create hinges, or work with a default rectangle
2. **Choose pattern type**: Select from available hinge patterns (line, fishbone, honeycomb, etc.)
3. **Adjust parameters**: Set cell size, spacing, rotation, and shape modifiers
4. **Preview the design**: Use the preview pane to see how the hinge will look
5. **Generate the hinge**: Click Generate to create the laser-cut pattern

### Available Controls

#### Pattern Selection
- **Pattern dropdown**: Choose from various hinge patterns:
  - **Line**: Simple parallel cuts for basic flexibility
  - **Fishbone**: Interlocking pattern for increased strength
  - **Honeycomb**: Complex cellular structure for maximum flexibility
  - **Diagonal/Zigzag**: Angled cuts for specific bend characteristics

#### Dimension Controls
- **Origin X/Y**: Position of the hinge area
- **Width/Height**: Size of the hinge pattern area
- **Cell-Width/Height**: Size of individual pattern elements (as percentage)
- **Offset X/Y**: Pattern positioning offsets

#### Pattern Modification
- **Rotation**: Rotate the entire hinge pattern
- **Parameters A/B**: Shape-specific modifiers that affect pattern characteristics

#### Generation Options
- **Algorithm selection**: Choose generation method:
  - **Pattern-Based (Complex)**: Detailed, feature-rich patterns
  - **Direct Grid (Simple)**: Fast generation for basic patterns
  - **Auto-Select**: Automatically chooses best method

#### Preview Controls
- **Preview Pattern**: Show the hinge cut lines
- **Preview Shape**: Show the boundary of the hinge area

### Advanced Usage

#### Creating Spring Mechanisms
For applications requiring energy storage:
1. Use tighter spacing (smaller cell sizes)
2. Choose patterns that create more material bridges
3. Test bend radius to ensure spring action without permanent deformation

#### Box Lid Hinges
For enclosure lids that need repeated opening:
1. Position hinges along the attachment edge
2. Use patterns with good fatigue resistance
3. Consider material thickness for appropriate flexibility

#### Robotic Joints
For articulated mechanisms:
1. Design hinge length for desired range of motion
2. Calculate bend radius based on application requirements
3. Test multiple iterations for optimal performance
