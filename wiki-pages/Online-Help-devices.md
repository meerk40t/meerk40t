## Description

The Devices panel serves as the command center for laser device management in MeerK40t. Modern laser cutting workflows often involve multiple devices - different laser types (CO2, fiber, UV, diode), various power levels, or specialized equipment for different materials. The Devices panel makes it easy to:

- **Switch between devices** without restarting the application
- **Configure device-specific settings** for optimal performance
- **Monitor device status** and connection health
- **Organize your workflow** with multiple laser systems

Each device maintains its own complete set of settings, operations, and configuration, allowing you to seamlessly switch between different laser cutters while preserving all your work.

## How to Use

### Accessing the Devices Panel

The Devices panel is available in two ways:

1. **As a pane**: Window → Panes → Devices (docks at bottom of interface)
2. **As a window**: Window → Device-Settings → Device Manager

### Device List Overview

The main device list shows all configured devices with the following information:

- **Device**: User-defined name/label for the device
- **Driver**: Internal driver type (grbl, balor, k40, etc.)
- **Type**: Laser source type (CO2, Fiber, UV, Diode)
- **Status**: Current operational status (idle, busy, paused, etc.)
- **Interface**: Connection method (USB, network, mock)

### Basic Usage

#### Creating a New Device

1. Click **"Create New Device"** button
2. Select your device type from the categorized list:
   - **K-Series CO2-Laser**: K40 and similar Chinese CO2 lasers
   - **Balor**: High-end galvo-based laser systems
   - **GRBL**: Generic GRBL-compatible devices
   - **Newly**: NewlyDraw laser controllers
   - **Moshiboard**: Moshi drawing robot controllers
3. Choose your specific device model
4. MeerK40t automatically assigns a unique name
5. Configure device settings in the device-specific configuration panel

#### Switching Between Devices

1. Select the desired device in the list
2. Click **"Activate"** button (or double-click the device)
3. The active device is highlighted in red
4. All operations and settings now apply to the newly activated device

#### Managing Device Settings

1. Select a device in the list
2. Click **"Config"** button to open device-specific settings
3. Adjust parameters like:
   - Connection settings
   - Laser power and speed defaults
   - Axis corrections and calibration
   - Safety limits and timing

#### Organizing Devices

1. **Rename**: Select device → "Rename" button → enter new name
2. **Duplicate**: Select device → "Duplicate" button → creates copy with "_copy" suffix
3. **Remove**: Select device → "Remove" button → permanently deletes device

## Technical Details

The Devices panel integrates deeply with MeerK40t's service architecture:

- **Service Management**: Each device is a kernel service with isolated settings
- **Signal Integration**: Responds to `pipe;running`, `pause`, and `activate;device` signals
- **Device Registry**: Discovers available device types through the `dev_info` system
- **Configuration Persistence**: All device settings are automatically saved and restored

### Device Lifecycle

1. **Registration**: Device types register themselves with the kernel
2. **Instantiation**: Devices are created with default settings
3. **Configuration**: User adjusts device-specific parameters
4. **Activation**: Device becomes the active laser controller
5. **Operation**: Device processes jobs and commands
6. **Deactivation**: Device can be switched out for another

### Device Types Supported

- **GRBL Devices**: Generic CNC controllers with laser support
- **Balor Devices**: High-performance galvo laser systems
- **K40 Devices**: Popular Chinese CO2 laser cutters
- **Newly Devices**: NewlyDraw laser controller boards
- **Moshiboard Devices**: Moshi drawing robot controllers
- **Mock Devices**: Software simulation for testing

### Configuration Integration

Each device type provides its own configuration panel with settings for:

- **Physical Parameters**: Lens size, laser spot size, bed dimensions
- **Connection Settings**: USB ports, network addresses, serial numbers
- **Operational Limits**: Maximum power, speed, and frequency
- **Safety Features**: Emergency stops, interlocks, and overrides
- **Calibration Data**: Correction files, axis alignment, and positioning

## Safety Considerations

- **Active Device Awareness**: Always verify which device is currently active before starting jobs
- **Device-Specific Limits**: Different lasers have different power and speed capabilities
- **Configuration Backup**: Important device settings should be documented
- **Hardware Verification**: Test new device configurations on scrap material first
- **Emergency Access**: Keep emergency stop buttons accessible when operating

## Troubleshooting

### Device Won't Activate

**Problem**: Clicking "Activate" doesn't switch devices
- **Check Device Status**: Ensure device is properly configured and connected
- **Configuration Errors**: Open device config panel and verify all required settings
- **Driver Issues**: Check USB connections and driver installation
- **Service Conflicts**: Restart MeerK40t if device services are unresponsive

### Device List Empty

**Problem**: No devices appear in the list
- **First Run**: Click "Create New Device" to add your first laser
- **Hidden Devices**: Check if devices are disabled in configuration
- **Service Errors**: Look for error messages in console output

### Configuration Won't Save

**Problem**: Device settings don't persist between sessions
- **Write Permissions**: Ensure MeerK40t has write access to its configuration directory
- **File Corruption**: Try duplicating the device and removing the original
- **Service Restart**: Restart MeerK40t after major configuration changes

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Device shows as disconnected
- **USB Stability**: Try different USB ports or cables
- **Power Supply**: Ensure laser has proper power and is turned on
- **Driver Installation**: Reinstall USB drivers (especially important for Windows)
- **Device Recognition**: Check device manager for hardware detection issues

### Multiple Device Conflicts

**Problem**: Devices interfere with each other
- **USB Bandwidth**: Spread devices across different USB controllers
- **Serial Numbers**: Configure unique identifiers for identical devices
- **Activation Verification**: Always confirm which device is active before operation

## Advanced Usage

### Multi-Device Workflows

Professional laser operations often involve multiple devices:

**Material-Based Routing**:
- CO2 laser for wood and acrylic
- Fiber laser for metals
- UV laser for plastics and glass

**Power-Based Segmentation**:
- High-power device for cutting
- Low-power device for engraving
- Specialized device for fine detail work

### Device Templates

Create device templates for quick setup:
1. Configure a device completely
2. Duplicate it for similar devices
3. Adjust only the unique parameters (USB port, calibration)

### Network Device Management

For network-connected lasers:
- Configure IP addresses and ports
- Set up authentication credentials
- Monitor network connectivity status
- Handle reconnection after network interruptions

### Automated Device Switching

Advanced users can create scripts that automatically switch devices based on:
- Material type detection
- Job requirements analysis
- Production scheduling
- Maintenance cycles
