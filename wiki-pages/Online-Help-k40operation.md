# Online Help: K40Operation

## Overview

The **K40Operation** panel provides advanced speed code features and optimization settings specifically for K40 laser controllers (Lihuiyu boards). These settings allow fine-tuning of laser movement characteristics to improve engraving quality and reduce stuttering artifacts.

**Lihuiyu/K40**

## Description

The K40Operation panel controls advanced parameters that affect how the Lihuiyu controller processes laser operations. These settings are particularly important for optimizing engraving quality on K40 laser systems, which use specialized speed codes to control laser behavior.

The panel provides controls for:
- **Diagonal Ratio (D-Ratio)**: Compensates for slower diagonal movements
- **Acceleration**: Overrides automatic acceleration selection
- **Dot Length**: Controls minimum laser-on time for dashed patterns
- **Pulse Grouping**: Reduces stuttering by grouping laser pulses

## How to Use

### Accessing the Panel

1. Select an operation in the Operations branch of the tree
2. Open the operation properties (double-click or right-click → Properties)
3. Navigate to the "Advanced" tab

### Available Controls

#### Custom D-Ratio
- **Checkbox**: Enables custom diagonal ratio override
- **Value Field**: Diagonal ratio value (default: 0.261)
- **Purpose**: Compensates for the additional time needed for diagonal steps vs orthogonal steps
- **Typical Values**: 0.261 (default), range 0.1-0.5
- **When to Use**: When diagonal engraving lines appear thinner or less consistent

#### Acceleration
- **Checkbox**: Enables acceleration override
- **Slider**: Acceleration level (1-4)
- **Purpose**: Controls laser head acceleration settings
- **Controller Behavior**: M2-nano has 4 acceleration levels, automatically selected based on speed
- **When to Use**: Override automatic selection for specific material/engraving requirements

#### Dot Length
- **Checkbox**: Enables custom dot length
- **Value Field**: Minimum dot length
- **Units**: Steps, mm, cm, inch, mil, %, or PPI
- **Purpose**: Sets minimum laser-on time when using PPI (Pulses Per Inch)
- **Effect**: Converts continuous burns to dashed patterns
- **Example**: Dot Length 500 with PPI 500 = 1/2" dashes and 1/2" gaps

#### Pulse Grouping
- **Checkbox**: Enables pulse grouping optimization
- **Purpose**: Reduces stuttering by swapping adjacent on/off bits
- **Technical Detail**: Converts X_X_ patterns to XX__ patterns
- **Benefit**: Allows higher speed engraving with reduced visible artifacts
- **Safety Note**: May cause slight overlap but differences are sub-micron

### Basic Usage Workflow

1. **Select Operation**: Choose the operation to optimize
2. **Enable Custom Settings**: Check boxes for parameters you want to override
3. **Adjust Values**: Set appropriate values based on your material and desired effect
4. **Test**: Run a small test engraving to verify settings
5. **Fine-tune**: Adjust values based on test results

### Advanced Usage Examples

#### High-Quality Engraving Setup
```
Custom D-Ratio: ✓ (0.261)
Acceleration: ✓ (Level 2)
Dot Length: ✓ (250 steps)
Pulse Grouping: ✓
```

#### Fast Raster Engraving
```
Custom D-Ratio: ✗ (use default)
Acceleration: ✓ (Level 4)
Dot Length: ✗ (use default)
Pulse Grouping: ✓
```

#### Precision Vector Cutting
```
Custom D-Ratio: ✓ (0.300)
Acceleration: ✓ (Level 1)
Dot Length: ✗ (not applicable)
Pulse Grouping: ✗ (not recommended for cuts)
```

## Technical Details

### Diagonal Ratio (D-Ratio)
The diagonal ratio compensates for the geometric fact that diagonal movements in stepper motor systems take longer than orthogonal movements. The Lihuiyu controller uses speed codes that account for this difference.

**Formula**: Diagonal time = Orthogonal time × (1 + D-Ratio)

**Default Value**: 0.261 (26.1% additional time for diagonals)

### Acceleration Control
The M2-nano controller has four acceleration settings:
- **Level 1**: Slowest acceleration (highest precision)
- **Level 2**: Medium-slow acceleration
- **Level 3**: Medium-fast acceleration
- **Level 4**: Fastest acceleration (highest speed)

The controller normally auto-selects based on cut/engrave speed, but this allows manual override.

### Dot Length and PPI
When using PPI (Pulses Per Inch), the dot length setting creates dashed patterns:

**Calculation**:
- PPI = pulses per inch
- Dot Length = minimum on-time in selected units
- Result: Alternating dashes and gaps

**Example**: PPI=500, Dot Length=250 steps → 0.5" dashes, 0.5" gaps

### Pulse Grouping Algorithm
This optimization reduces laser stuttering by rearranging pulse patterns:
- **Before**: X_X_ (alternating on/off)
- **After**: XX__ (grouped on/off)
- **Benefit**: Fewer state changes reduce mechanical stress
- **Trade-off**: Slight position offset (< 1/1000")

## Safety Considerations

- **Test First**: Always test settings on scrap material before production runs
- **Material Compatibility**: Different materials may require different optimization settings
- **Speed vs Quality**: Higher acceleration may reduce precision
- **Controller Limits**: Respect your K40 controller's operational limits

## Troubleshooting

### Diagonal Lines Too Light
**Problem**: Diagonal engraving appears lighter than horizontal/vertical
**Solution**: Increase D-Ratio value (try 0.300-0.350)

### Stuttering During Engraving
**Problem**: Visible artifacts or inconsistent engraving
**Solutions**:
- Enable Pulse Grouping
- Reduce acceleration level
- Adjust D-Ratio

### Inconsistent Dot Patterns
**Problem**: PPI dots are uneven or missing
**Solution**: Adjust Dot Length value or disable custom dot length
