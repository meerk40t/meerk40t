"""Common methods for grouping overlapping raster elements.

Currently used:

*   During 2-pass classification to ensure that overlapping raster elements
    are classified to the same Raster operation(s)

*   When creating images from rasters during planning to avoid creating a single huge raster
    and optimise raster time by avoiding sweeping large empty areas.
