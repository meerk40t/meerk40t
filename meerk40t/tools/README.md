# Tools

Tools are stand-alone utilities that help with various processes and may be shared among different functions. These are
unrelated to the functionality of the kernel ecosystem.

These can largely be removed and used whole-cloth without requiring any additional code scaffolding.

## JhfParser

Parser for Jhf file format hershey parser.

## Pathtools

PathTools are largely code which helps implement the Eulerian Fill algorithm.

## Point Finder (Disabled)

Point Finder is intended as an acceleration structure for solving the nearest point algorithm.

## Polybool

The polybool implementation is MIT licensed from https://github.com/KaivnD/pypolybool

## RasterPlotter

Rasterplotter deals with the conversion of pixels into discrete laser commands, performing a `Raster` operation.

## ShxParser

Parser for shx (Adobe) font files. This is another common type of line fonts.

This is also a stand-alone library: https://github.com/tatarize/shxparser

## TTFParser

Pure python parser for true type fonts.

## ZinglPlotter

ZinglPlotter deals with the plotting of vector shapes and their conversion into pixel perfect laser movements. Based on
the Zingl-Bresenham Algorithms.

This is also a stand-alone library at: https://github.com/meerk40t/zinglplotter
