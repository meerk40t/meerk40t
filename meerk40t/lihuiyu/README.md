# Lihuiyu

These are the stock M2 Nano boards by Lihuiyu and other closely related boards. This is the primary user of CH341 interfacing drivers. And the most complete driver available. This includes parsing of Lhymicro-GL, production of Lhymicro-GL, channels of the data being sent over the USB. As well as emulation and parsing the commands.
