# Lihuiyu

Driver for the M2/M3 Nano boards by Lihuiyu and other closely related boards. This is the primary user of CH341
interfacing drivers. And the most complete driver available. This includes parsing of Lhymicro-GL, production of
Lhymicro-GL, channels of the data being sent over the USB, as well as emulation and parsing the commands.
