# Rotary

The Rotary Module is intended to implement rotary. Currently, the supported rotary type is a y-axis replacement rotary. This rotary allows a toggle to turn on extra transformations to the .device view. This will occur regardless what device is being used. If the rotary service is being used, the currently selected .device will permit this extra perspective toggle.
