# Moshi

Moshiboard classes are intended to deal with USB interactions to and from the CH341 chips on Moshiboards over USB. This
is the result of `Project Moshi` which sought to reverse engineer the Moshiboard interactions and control them with
MeerK40t. Thanks to a generous donation of a Moshiboard by Domm434 ( https://forum.makerforums.info/u/domm434 ).
MeerK40t is now compatible with Moshiboards.
