# Utility Widgets

The utility widgets provide for various reusable control widgets. These are intended to be independent of the scenewidgets and should be useful for any other uses of scene. They should not contain complex multipart widgets but rather simple control style widgets that may be useful in assembling a scene for other projects and not just this project.
